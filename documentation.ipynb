    "# Identifying and Defining\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose your Data Scenario and Define your Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** The dataset which I have chosen has the statistics of all the NBA players over each season from 1996-2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To find out the if, the players height correlates to the average number of rebounds they have collected each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access:** This particular dataset is open to the public using kaggle.com and to access this data you must create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access Method:** The data is accessed using the .csv format\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Loading:** The program must be able to load various file types, such as CSV and Excel, while handling errors related to incorrect formats or missing files. The user will provide the file path, file name, and file type, along with optional parameters for reading the file, like a delimiter for CSV files. The program will output a loaded DataFrame or display error messages for issues like incorrect file formats or missing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning:** The program needs to manage missing values and allow for data operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping. The user will input a DataFrame and specify instructions for handling missing values, filtering criteria, sorting order, and grouping columns. The output will be a cleaned DataFrame and a summary of the cleaning operations performed, such as the number of rows dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analysis:** The system must enable various statistical analyses, including calculating the mean, median, and mode. Users will input a DataFrame and specify the type of analysis to be performed, such as calculating the mean of a specific column. The program will output the results of the analysis, such as the mean value, along with a summary of the analysis performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Visualisation:** The program should visualise data using Pandas dataframes and Matplotlib chart types, such as bar charts and line charts. Users will provide a DataFrame, specify the type of visualisation (e.g., bar chart, line chart), and set parameters for the chart, including x and y axis columns, title, and labels. The program will generate and display the chart on the screen, with an option to save it as an image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Reporting:** The system should generate reports that include the final dataset and offer options to save the report as a .csv or .txt file. Users will input the DataFrame to be reported and choose the report format (e.g., .csv, .txt), along with any optional parameters like summary statistics. The program will produce the report in the specified format and save the final dataset and report to a file.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usability**\n",
    "\n",
    "For usability, the User Interface (UI) should be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring that users can perform their tasks with minimal effort. This includes clear labeling of buttons and functions, consistent layout and design, and accessible features for all users. Additionally, the UI should provide immediate feedback on user actions to confirm that inputs have been registered. A comprehensive 'README' document is also required, detailing installation steps, usage instructions, troubleshooting tips, and examples to guide users through the system's functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding reliability, the system must ensure accurate and consistent performance under all expected conditions. This involves providing clear and informative error messages when issues arise, allowing users to understand and rectify problems without confusion. The system should implement mechanisms to ensure data integrity, such as validation checks and backup procedures, to prevent data loss or corruption. Regular testing and maintenance schedules should be established to identify and address potential issues promptly, ensuring the system remains dependable over time.\n",

    "# Research and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research of Chosen Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to determine the correlation between player height, rebounds, and points in the NBA from 1996 to 2022. This is crucial for player development, scouting, and strategic decision-making. Understanding these correlations can lead to better-informed decisions and improved game strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Missing Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing information on this topic is often limited to specific seasons or subsets of players. There is a lack of comprehensive, longitudinal studies that span multiple decades. This analysis aims to fill these gaps by providing updated insights and a broad perspective on the evolution of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "NBA teams and coaches will benefit from enhanced player development programs and strategies. Scouts and analysts will gain more accurate insights for player evaluation. Players and sports scientists can use the findings to understand performance influences and contribute to sports science research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings can be applied to tailor player training programs to optimise performance. Drafting and recruitment processes can become more informed and strategic. Additionally, the analysis can help develop performance prediction models and strategic game plans based on player attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Privacy and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Privacy of Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset which I have chosen, containing all NBA players from 1996 to 2022, is sourced from a public website housing a countless number of datasets named kaggle.com. Kaggle and other various sources have a responsibility to protect sensitive information that may include personal details beyond publicly available statistics. They must ensure compliance with data protection regulations, such as anonymising any personal information and securing data storage to prevent unauthorised access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Application Data Privacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the analyst, my responsibility is to ensure that the data remains secure and private. While the dataset primarily includes public performance statistics, any identifiable personal data must be handled with care. If this application were to be released publicly, I would need to ensure that no sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed, and that user privacy is maintained through robust data protection practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cyber Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "An application designed for public use must incorporate several key cybersecurity features to ensure data integrity and user safety.\n",
    "* **User Authentication:** This process verifies the identity of users attempting to access the application. It often involves requiring a username and password, and can be strengthened with multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification methods such as a code sent to a phone.\n",
    "* **Password Hashing:** Password hashing is the practice of transforming plain text passwords into a fixed-length string of characters, which are stored in the database. Hashing algorithms like bcrypt or SHA-256 ensure that even if the database is compromised, the passwords are not easily retrievable. This protects user accounts from unauthorised access.\n",
    "* **Encryption:** Encryption involves converting data into a code to prevent unauthorised access. Data should be encrypted both at rest (when stored) and in transit (when being sent over networks) to ensure that sensitive information is protected from interception and breaches. This can involve using protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to secure data transmission over the internet.\n",
