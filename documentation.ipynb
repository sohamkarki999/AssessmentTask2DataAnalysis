    "# Identifying and Defining\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose your Data Scenario and Define your Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** The dataset which I have chosen has the statistics of all the NBA players over each season from 1996-2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To find out the if, the players age correlates to the average number of points they have scored each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access:** This particular dataset is open to the public using kaggle.com and to access this data you must create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access Method:** The data is accessed using the .csv format\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Loading:** The program must be able to load various file types, such as CSV and Excel, while handling errors related to incorrect formats or missing files. The user will provide the file path, file name, and file type, along with optional parameters for reading the file, like a delimiter for CSV files. The program will output a loaded DataFrame or display error messages for issues like incorrect file formats or missing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning:** The program needs to manage missing values and allow for data operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping. The user will input a DataFrame and specify instructions for handling missing values, filtering criteria, sorting order, and grouping columns. The output will be a cleaned DataFrame and a summary of the cleaning operations performed, such as the number of rows dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analysis:** The system must enable various statistical analyses, including calculating the mean, median, and mode. Users will input a DataFrame and specify the type of analysis to be performed, such as calculating the mean of a specific column. The program will output the results of the analysis, such as the mean value, along with a summary of the analysis performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Visualisation:** The program should visualise data using Pandas dataframes and Matplotlib chart types, such as bar charts and line charts. Users will provide a DataFrame, specify the type of visualisation (e.g., bar chart, line chart), and set parameters for the chart, including x and y axis columns, title, and labels. The program will generate and display the chart on the screen, with an option to save it as an image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Reporting:** The system should generate reports that include the final dataset and offer options to save the report as a .csv or .txt file. Users will input the DataFrame to be reported and choose the report format (e.g., .csv, .txt), along with any optional parameters like summary statistics. The program will produce the report in the specified format and save the final dataset and report to a file.\n",
