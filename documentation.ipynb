    "# Identifying and Defining\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose your Data Scenario and Define your Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** The dataset which I have chosen has the statistics of all the NBA players over each season from 1996-2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To find out that if, the players height correlates to the average number of rebounds they have collected each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access:** This particular dataset is open to the public using kaggle.com and to access this data you must create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access Method:** The data is accessed using the .csv format\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Loading:** The program must be able to load various file types, such as CSV and Excel, while handling errors related to incorrect formats or missing files. The user will provide the file path, file name, and file type, along with optional parameters for reading the file, like a delimiter for CSV files. The program will output a loaded DataFrame or display error messages for issues like incorrect file formats or missing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning:** The program needs to manage missing values and allow for data operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping. The user will input a DataFrame and specify instructions for handling missing values, filtering criteria, sorting order, and grouping columns. The output will be a cleaned DataFrame and a summary of the cleaning operations performed, such as the number of rows dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analysis:** The system must enable various statistical analyses, including calculating the mean, median, and mode. Users will input a DataFrame and specify the type of analysis to be performed, such as calculating the mean of a specific column. The program will output the results of the analysis, such as the mean value, along with a summary of the analysis performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Visualisation:** The program should visualise data using Pandas dataframes and Matplotlib chart types, such as bar charts and line charts. Users will provide a DataFrame, specify the type of visualisation (e.g., bar chart, line chart), and set parameters for the chart, including x and y axis columns, title, and labels. The program will generate and display the chart on the screen, with an option to save it as an image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Reporting:** The system should generate reports that include the final dataset and offer options to save the report as a .csv or .txt file. Users will input the DataFrame to be reported and choose the report format (e.g., .csv, .txt), along with any optional parameters like summary statistics. The program will produce the report in the specified format and save the final dataset and report to a file.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usability**\n",
    "\n",
    "For usability, the User Interface (UI) should be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring that users can perform their tasks with minimal effort. This includes clear labeling of buttons and functions, consistent layout and design, and accessible features for all users. Additionally, the UI should provide immediate feedback on user actions to confirm that inputs have been registered. A comprehensive 'README' document is also required, detailing installation steps, usage instructions, troubleshooting tips, and examples to guide users through the system's functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding reliability, the system must ensure accurate and consistent performance under all expected conditions. This involves providing clear and informative error messages when issues arise, allowing users to understand and rectify problems without confusion. The system should implement mechanisms to ensure data integrity, such as validation checks and backup procedures, to prevent data loss or corruption. Regular testing and maintenance schedules should be established to identify and address potential issues promptly, ensuring the system remains dependable over time.\n",

    "# Research and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research of Chosen Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to determine the correlation between player height, rebounds, and points in the NBA from 1996 to 2022. This is crucial for player development, scouting, and strategic decision-making. Understanding these correlations can lead to better-informed decisions and improved game strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Missing Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing information on this topic is often limited to specific seasons or subsets of players. There is a lack of comprehensive, longitudinal studies that span multiple decades. This analysis aims to fill these gaps by providing updated insights and a broad perspective on the evolution of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "NBA teams and coaches will benefit from enhanced player development programs and strategies. Scouts and analysts will gain more accurate insights for player evaluation. Players and sports scientists can use the findings to understand performance influences and contribute to sports science research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings can be applied to tailor player training programs to optimise performance. Drafting and recruitment processes can become more informed and strategic. Additionally, the analysis can help develop performance prediction models and strategic game plans based on player attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Privacy and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Privacy of Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset which I have chosen, containing all NBA players from 1996 to 2022, is sourced from a public website housing a countless number of datasets named kaggle.com. Kaggle and other various sources have a responsibility to protect sensitive information that may include personal details beyond publicly available statistics. They must ensure compliance with data protection regulations, such as anonymising any personal information and securing data storage to prevent unauthorised access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Application Data Privacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the analyst, my responsibility is to ensure that the data remains secure and private. While the dataset primarily includes public performance statistics, any identifiable personal data must be handled with care. If this application were to be released publicly, I would need to ensure that no sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed, and that user privacy is maintained through robust data protection practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cyber Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "An application designed for public use must incorporate several key cybersecurity features to ensure data integrity and user safety.\n",
    "* **User Authentication:** This process verifies the identity of users attempting to access the application. It often involves requiring a username and password, and can be strengthened with multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification methods such as a code sent to a phone.\n",
    "* **Password Hashing:** Password hashing is the practice of transforming plain text passwords into a fixed-length string of characters, which are stored in the database. Hashing algorithms like bcrypt or SHA-256 ensure that even if the database is compromised, the passwords are not easily retrievable. This protects user accounts from unauthorised access.\n",
    "* **Encryption:** Encryption involves converting data into a code to prevent unauthorised access. Data should be encrypted both at rest (when stored) and in transit (when being sent over networks) to ensure that sensitive information is protected from interception and breaches. This can involve using protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to secure data transmission over the internet.\n",

    "I adjusted my code by removing the previous functions that focused on points and planned to add a new visualisation function related to rebounds, which aligns better with my question. After making these changes, I prepared to implement the new function but encountered issues while shifting focus from points to rebounds. The code did not work as intended because the previous functions were not relevant to the rebounds analysis, leading to challenges in restructuring the code as it didn't view the data as numerical. Next, I need to successfully implement the new visualisation function and ensure it accurately reflects the relationship between height and rebounds, as well as make my code neater using inline comments and sectioning ecah segment of the code."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "The project calculated the correlation between player height and rebounds by averaging rebounds across different height ranges and plotting these against height. The calculations were performed using Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib, ensuring data manipulation and statistical methods were accurately applied. These calculations were crucial for visualising the relationship and determining the correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the information was confirmed by using verified NBA data and standard statistical methods, ensuring reliable results. The trend line and correlation coefficient were consistent with known basketball analytics, which indicates that taller players generally rebound more effectively. Cross-referencing with subsets of the data further validated the accuracy of the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between player height and rebounds, confirming that taller players tend to have more rebounds. This insight is valuable for coaches and analysts in player selection as well as team strategy. The findings reinforce the importance of height in basketball and provide as well as how data analysis can be used in our lifes.\n",

    "## Evaluation of Final Product in Relation to Functional and Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary functional requirements were to analyse the correlation between player height and rebounds and to provide a visual representation of this relationship. I implemented a text-based Python interface that could read NBA player data, perform the necessary calculations, and output a trend line showing the correlation. During the development phasee, I refined the code by focusing on relevant data and ensuring the accuracy of the calculations. Testing showed that the program successfully met its core functional requirements by providing a clear and accurate trend line that represented the correlation between height and rebounds. Overall, the program performed as expected in relation to the functional requirements. The visualisation was accurate, the interface allowed for efficient data analysis, and the code was structured to facilitate future modifications or additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the non-functional requirements, the project was evaluated on factors such as usability, maintainability, and performance. The non-functional requirements included a user-friendly interface, well-documented code, and efficient processing of large datasets. I added comments and segmented the code to enhance readability and maintainability, ensuring that the program was user-friendly and easy to understand. The code was also optimised to handle the dataset efficiently, minimising delays in processing. In testing, the program met the non-functional requirements by running efficiently without significant lag, even with large datasets. The documentation provided clear guidance, which improved the usability and maintainability of the code. The project effectively fulfilled the non-functional requirements, making the program not only functional but also user-friendly and easy to maintain. The code structure and documentation facilitated a smooth user experience and ensured that the program could be easily modified or expanded upon in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation of your Project in Relation to Testing and Project Management\n",
    "\n",
    "I initiated the project with a clear plan to analyse the correlation between player height and rebounds, which guided my subsequent actions. During the development phase, I focused on making the code more understandable by adding comments and segmenting it into logical parts. This helped streamline the process and made debugging more efficient. However, my time management had some challenges, as I initially spent too much time on functions related to points rather than rebounds. I rigorosly tested the code and identified the need to shift focus, overcoming challenges by removing irrelevant functions and implementing a new visualisation that aligned with the project goals. Despite these setbacks, I put considerable effort into refining the code and ensuring the final output was both accurate and visually informative. Overall, my project management showed adaptability and a commitment to problem-solving, though with room for improvement in time allocation and initial focus."
